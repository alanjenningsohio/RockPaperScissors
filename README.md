# RockPaperScissors
Rock-Paper-Scissor game to explore AI players
Tags: multiplayer, AI

This is my first pygame project, and it is not finished yet. 
The first menu lets you select the player options (human, random, or a strategy). Players can select their move with the buttons on their side, or by using keyboard commands (qaz or pl, for rock-paper-scissors for left and right respectively). AI will continue to make selections until time runs out. After time runs out, the winner (if there is one) is declared. 
Score is kept track of, but can be reset without resetting AI memory. 

Known issues: 
Needs a help menu
Images should be masked before release (uses a random bit map, or set of bitmaps)
There some video issue on quiting
